Belgian localization for in- and outgoing invoices (prereq to account_coda):
============================================================================
    - Rename 'reference' field labels to 'Communication'
    - Add support for Belgian Structured Communication

A Structured Communication can be generated automatically on outgoing invoices according to the following algorithms:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1) Random : +++RRR/RRRR/RRRDD+++
        **R..R =** Random Digits, **DD =** Check Digits
    2) Date : +++DOY/YEAR/SSSDD+++
        **DOY =** Day of the Year, **SSS =** Sequence Number, **DD =** Check Digits
    3) Customer Reference +++RRR/RRRR/SSSDDD+++
        **R..R =** Customer Reference without non-numeric characters, **SSS =** Sequence Number, **DD =** Check Digits  
        
The preferred type of Structured Communication and associated Algorithm can be
specified on the Partner records. A 'random' Structured Communication will
generated if no algorithm is specified on the Partner record.

propagate those new data properly.

It's important to note however that this module lack many implementations to 
use OpenERP properly in Brazil. Those implementations (such as the electronic 
fiscal Invoicing which is already operational) are brought by more than 15 
additional modules of the Brazilian Launchpad localization project 
https://launchpad.net/openerp.pt-br-localiz and their dependencies in the 
extra addons branch. Those modules aim at not breaking with the remarkable 
OpenERP modularity, this is why they are numerous but small. One of the 
reasons for maintaining those modules apart is that Brazilian Localization 
leaders need commit rights agility to complete the localization as companies 
fund the remaining legal requirements (such as soon fiscal ledgers, 
accounting SPED, fiscal SPED and PAF ECF that are still missing as September 
2011). Those modules are also strictly licensed under AGPL V3 and today don't 
come with any additional paid permission for online use of 'private modules'.

EU Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) VAT for telecommunications, broadcasting and electronic services
=============================================================================================

As of January 1rst, 2015, telecommunications, broadcasting
and electronic services sold within the European Union
have to be always taxed in the country where the customer
belongs. In order to simplify the application of this EU
directive, the Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) registration scheme
allows businesses to make a unique tax declaration.

This module makes it possible by helping with the creation
of the required EU fiscal positions and taxes in order to
automatically apply and record the required taxes.

This module installs a wizard to help setup fiscal positions
and taxes for selling electronic services inside EU.

The wizard lets you select:
 - the EU countries to which you are selling these
   services
 - your national VAT tax for services, to be mapped
   to the target country's tax
 - optionally: a template fiscal position, in order
   to copy the account mapping. Should be your
   existing B2C Intra-EU fiscal position. (defaults
   to no account mapping)
 - optionally: an account to use for collecting the
   tax amounts (defaults to the account used by your
   national VAT tax for services)

It creates the corresponding fiscal positions and taxes,
automatically applicable for EU sales with a customer
in the selected countries.
The wizard can be run again for adding more countries.

The wizard creates a separate Chart of Taxes for collecting the
VAT amounts of the MOSS declaration, so extracting the MOSS
data should be easy.
Look for a Chart of Taxes named ""EU MOSS VAT Chart"" in the
Taxes Report menu (Generic Accounting Report).

Email Templating (simplified version of the original Power Email by Openlabs).
==============================================================================

Lets you design complete email templates related to any OpenERP document (Sale
Orders, Invoices and so on), including sender, recipient, subject, body (HTML and
Text). You may also automatically attach files to your templates, or print and
attach a report.

For advanced use, the templates may include dynamic attributes of the document
they are related to. For example, you may use the name of a Partner's country
when writing to them, also providing a safe default in case the attribute is
not defined. Each template contains a built-in assistant to help with the
inclusion of these dynamic values.

If you enable the option, a composition assistant will also appear in the sidebar
of the OpenERP documents to which the template applies (e.g. Invoices).
This serves as a quick way to send a new email based on the template, after
reviewing and adapting the contents, if needed.
This composition assistant will also turn into a mass mailing system when called
for multiple documents at once.

These email templates are also at the heart of the marketing campaign system
(see the ``marketing_campaign`` application), if you need to automate larger
campaigns on any OpenERP document.

    **Technical note:** only the templating system of the original Power Email by Openlabs was kept.

Encrypted passwords
===================

Replaces the default password storage with a strong cryptographic
hash.

The key derivation function currently used is RSA Security LLC's
industry-standard ``PKDF2``, in combination with ``SHA512``.
This includes salting and key stretching with several thousands
rounds.

All passwords are encrypted as soon as the module is installed.
This may take a few minutes if there are thousands of users.

Past versions of encrypted passwords will be automatically upgraded
to the current scheme whenever a user authenticates
(``auth_crypt`` was previously using the weaker ``md5crypt`` key
derivation function).

Note: Installing this module permanently prevents user password
recovery and cannot be undone. It is thus recommended to enable
some password reset mechanism for users, such as the one provided

necessarily have to be enabled).

Module to import CODA bank statements.

Supported are CODA flat files in V2 format from Belgian bank accounts.

    * CODA v1 support.
    * CODA v2.2 support.
    * Foreign Currency support.
    * Support for all data record types (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9).
    * Parsing & logging of all Transaction Codes and Structured Format
      Communications.
    * Automatic Financial Journal assignment via CODA configuration parameters.
    * Support for multiple Journals per Bank Account Number.
    * Support for multiple statements from different bank accounts in a single
      CODA file.
    * Support for 'parsing only' CODA Bank Accounts (defined as type='info' in
      the CODA Bank Account configuration records).
    * Multi-language CODA parsing, parsing configuration data provided for EN,
      NL, FR.

The machine readable CODA Files are parsed and stored in human readable format in
CODA Bank Statements. Also Bank Statements are generated containing a subset of
the CODA information (only those transaction lines that are required for the
creation of the Financial Accounting records). The CODA Bank Statement is a
'read-only' object, hence remaining a reliable representation of the original
CODA file whereas the Bank Statement will get modified as required by accounting
business processes.

CODA Bank Accounts configured as type 'Info' will only generate CODA Bank Statements.

A removal of one object in the CODA processing results in the removal of the
associated objects. The removal of a CODA File containing multiple Bank
Statements will also remove those associated statements.

Instead of a manual adjustment of the generated Bank Statements, you can also
re-import the CODA after updating the OpenERP database with the information that
was missing to allow automatic reconciliation.

Remark on CODA V1 support:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In some cases a transaction code, transaction category or structured
communication code has been given a new or clearer description in CODA V2.The
description provided by the CODA configuration tables is based upon the CODA
V2.2 specifications.
If required, you can manually adjust the descriptions via the CODA configuration menu.

~~~~~~~~
The confirmation of a payment order does _not_ create accounting entries, it just 
records the fact that you gave your payment order to your bank. The booking of

New extensible file import for OpenERP

Re-implement openerp's file import system:

  other forms of automation) and makes knowledge about the
  import/export system much harder to gather as it is spread over
  3+ different projects.

* In a more extensible manner, so users and partners can build their
  own front-end to import from other file formats (e.g. OpenDocument
  files) which may be simpler to handle in their work flow or from
  their data production sources.

* In a module, so that administrators and users of OpenERP who do not

The generic OpenERP Customer Relationship Management
====================================================

This application enables a group of people to intelligently and efficiently manage leads, opportunities, meetings and phone calls.

It manages key tasks such as communication, identification, prioritization, assignment, resolution and notification.

OpenERP ensures that all cases are successfully tracked by users, customers and suppliers. It can automatically send reminders, escalate the request, trigger specific methods and many other actions based on your own enterprise rules.

The greatest thing about this system is that users don't need to do anything special. The CRM module has an email gateway for the synchronization interface between mails and OpenERP. That way, users can just send emails to the request tracker.

OpenERP will take care of thanking them for their message, automatically routing it to the appropriate staff and make sure all future correspondence gets to the right place.

can also go into exception, for example when it can not find a rule and it can be cancelled.

The mechanism will be extended by several modules.  The procurement rule of stock will
create a move and the procurement will be fulfilled when the move is done.
The procurement rule of sale_service will create a task.  Those of purchase or
mrp will create a purchase order or a manufacturing order.

it can put running procurements to done.

Fiscal positions
----------------

When considering taxes to be applied, it is the province where the delivery occurs that matters. 
Therefore we decided to implement the most common case in the fiscal positions: delivery is the 
responsibility of the supplier and done at the customer location.

Some examples:

1) You have a customer from another province and you deliver to his location.
On the customer, set the fiscal position to his province.

2) You have a customer from another province. However this customer comes to your location
with their truck to pick up products. On the customer, do not set any fiscal position.

3) An international supplier doesn't charge you any tax. Taxes are charged at customs 
by the customs broker. On the supplier, set the fiscal position to International.

4) An international supplier charge you your provincial tax. They are registered with your
provincial government and remit taxes themselves. On the supplier, do not set any fiscal 
position.

This is the module to manage the accounting chart for France in OpenERP.
========================================================================

This module applies to companies based in France mainland. It doesn't apply to
companies based in the DOM-TOMs (Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane, Réunion, Mayotte).

This localisation module creates the VAT taxes of type 'tax included' for purchases
(it is notably required when you use the module 'hr_expense'). Beware that these
'tax included' VAT taxes are not managed by the fiscal positions provided by this
module (because it is complex to manage both 'tax excluded' and 'tax included'
scenarios in fiscal positions).

This localisation module doesn't properly handle the scenario when a France-mainland
company sells services to a company based in the DOMs. We could manage it in the
fiscal positions, but it would require to differentiate between 'product' VAT taxes
and 'service' VAT taxes. We consider that it is too 'heavy' to have this by default
in l10n_fr; companies that sell services to DOM-based companies should update the
configuration of their taxes and fiscal positions manually.

The module allows:
------------------
    - HTML report definition
    - Multi header support
    - Multi logo
    - Multi company support
    - HTML and CSS-3 support (In the limit of the actual WebKIT version)

    - Raw HTML debugger
    - Book printing capabilities
    - Margins definition
    - Paper size definition

Multiple headers and logos can be defined per company. CSS style, header and
footer body are defined per company.

For a sample report see also the webkit_report_sample module, and this video:
    http://files.me.com/nbessi/06n92k.mov

Requirements and Installation:
------------------------------
This module requires the ``wkhtmltopdf`` library to render HTML documents as
PDF. Version 0.9.9 or later is necessary, and can be found at
http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/ for Linux, Mac OS X (i386) and Windows (32bits).

After installing the library on the OpenERP Server machine, you may need to set
the path to the ``wkhtmltopdf`` executable file in a system parameter named
``webkit_path`` in Settings -> Customization -> Parameters -> System Parameters

If you are experiencing missing header/footer problems on Linux, be sure to
install a 'static' version of the library. The default ``wkhtmltopdf`` on
Ubuntu is known to have this issue.

This module allows to use several analytic plans according to the general journal.

      * Project 2
      
  * **Salesman**
      * Eric
      
      * Fabien

Here, we have two plans: Projects and Salesman. An invoice line must be able to write analytic entries in the 2 plans: SubProj 1.1 and Fabien. The amount can also be split.
 
The following example is for an invoice that touches the two subprojects and assigned to one salesman:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Plan1:**

    * SubProject 1.1 : 50%
    
    * SubProject 1.2 : 50%
    
**Plan2:**
    Eric: 100%

So when this line of invoice will be confirmed, it will generate 3 analytic lines,for one account entry.

The analytic plan validates the minimum and maximum percentage at the time of creation of distribution models.

Use notes to write meeting minutes, organize ideas, organize personal todo
lists, etc. Each user manages his own personal Notes. Notes are available to
their authors only, but they can share notes to others users so that several
people can work on the same note in real time. It's very efficient to share
meeting minutes.

Notes can be found in the 'Home' menu.

base,model,"ir.module.module,description",base.module_crm_profiling,"
This module allows users to perform segmentation within partners.
=================================================================

It uses the profiles criteria from the earlier segmentation module and improve it. 
Thanks to the new concept of questionnaire. You can now regroup questions into a 
questionnaire and directly use it on a partner.

It also has been merged with the earlier CRM & SRM segmentation tool because they 
were overlapping.

base,model,"ir.module.module,description",base.module_anonymization,"
This module allows you to anonymize a database.
===============================================

This module allows you to keep your data confidential for a given database.
This process is useful, if you want to use the migration process and protect
your own or your customer’s confidential data. The principle is that you run
an anonymization tool which will hide your confidential data(they are replaced
by ‘XXX’ characters). Then you can send the anonymized database to the migration
team. Once you get back your migrated database, you restore it and reverse the
anonymization process to recover your previous data.

This module allows you to define what is the default function of a specific user on a given account.
====================================================================================================

This is mostly used when a user encodes his timesheet: the values are retrieved
and the fields are auto-filled. But the possibility to change these values is
still available.

Obviously if no data has been recorded for the current account, the default
value is given as usual by the employee data so that this module is perfectly
compatible with older configurations.

",
base,model,"ir.module.module,description",base.module_l10n_fr_rib,"
This module lets users enter the banking details of Partners in the RIB format (French standard for bank accounts details).
===========================================================================================================================

RIB Bank Accounts can be entered in the ""Accounting"" tab of the Partner form by specifying the account type ""RIB"". 

The four standard RIB fields will then become mandatory:
--------------------------------------------------------    
    - Bank Code
    - Office Code
    - Account number
    - RIB key
    
As a safety measure, OpenERP will check the RIB key whenever a RIB is saved, and
will refuse to record the data if the key is incorrect. Please bear in mind that
this can only happen when the user presses the 'save' button, for example on the
Partner Form. Since each bank account may relate to a Bank, users may enter the
RIB Bank Code in the Bank form - it will the pre-fill the Bank Code on the RIB
when they select the Bank. To make this easier, this module will also let users
find Banks using their RIB code.

The module base_iban can be a useful addition to this module, because French banks
are now progressively adopting the international IBAN format instead of the RIB format.
The RIB and IBAN codes for a single account can be entered by recording two Bank
Accounts in OpenERP: the first with the type 'RIB', the second with the type 'IBAN'. 
",
base,model,"ir.module.module,description",base.module_product_visible_discount,"
This module lets you calculate discounts on Sale Order lines and Invoice lines base on the partner's pricelist.
===============================================================================================================

To this end, a new check box named 'Visible Discount' is added to the pricelist form.

**Example:**
    For the product PC1 and the partner ""Asustek"": if listprice=450, and the price
    calculated using Asustek's pricelist is 225. If the check box is checked, we
    will have on the sale order line: Unit price=450, Discount=50,00, Net price=225.
    If the check box is unchecked, we will have on Sale Order and Invoice lines:
    Unit price=225, Discount=0,00, Net price=225.

base,model,"ir.module.module,description",base.module_marketing_campaign,"
This module provides leads automation through marketing campaigns (campaigns can in fact be defined on any resource, not just CRM Leads).
=========================================================================================================================================

The campaigns are dynamic and multi-channels. The process is as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * Design marketing campaigns like workflows, including email templates to
      send, reports to print and send by email, custom actions
    * Define input segments that will select the items that should enter the
      campaign (e.g leads from certain countries.)
    * Run your campaign in simulation mode to test it real-time or accelerated,
      and fine-tune it
    * You may also start the real campaign in manual mode, where each action
      requires manual validation
    * Finally launch your campaign live, and watch the statistics as the
      campaign does everything fully automatically.

While the campaign runs you can of course continue to fine-tune the parameters,
input segments, workflow.

**Note:** If you need demo data, you can install the marketing_campaign_crm_demo
      module, but this will also install the CRM application as it depends on
      CRM Leads.

base,model,"ir.module.module,description",base.module_account_anglo_saxon,"
This module supports the Anglo-Saxon accounting methodology by changing the accounting logic with stock transactions.
=====================================================================================================================

The difference between the Anglo-Saxon accounting countries and the Rhine 
(or also called Continental accounting) countries is the moment of taking 
the Cost of Goods Sold versus Cost of Sales. Anglo-Saxons accounting does 
take the cost when sales invoice is created, Continental accounting will 
take the cost at the moment the goods are shipped.

This module will add this functionality by using a interim account, to 
store the value of shipped goods and will contra book this interim 
account when the invoice is created to transfer this amount to the 
debtor or creditor account. Secondly, price differences between actual 
purchase price and fixed product standard price are booked on a separate 
account.",

VAT validation for Partner's VAT numbers.
=========================================

After installing this module, values entered in the VAT field of Partners will
be validated for all supported countries. The country is inferred from the
2-letter country code that prefixes the VAT number, e.g. ``BE0477472701``
will be validated using the Belgian rules.

There are two different levels of VAT number validation:
--------------------------------------------------------
    * By default, a simple off-line check is performed using the known validation
      rules for the country, usually a simple check digit. This is quick and 
      always available, but allows numbers that are perhaps not truly allocated,
      or not valid anymore.
      
    * When the ""VAT VIES Check"" option is enabled (in the configuration of the user's
      Company), VAT numbers will be instead submitted to the online EU VIES
      database, which will truly verify that the number is valid and currently
      allocated to a EU company. This is a little bit slower than the simple
      off-line check, requires an Internet connection, and may not be available
      all the time. If the service is not available or does not support the
      requested country (e.g. for non-EU countries), a simple check will be performed
      instead.

Supported countries currently include EU countries, and a few non-EU countries
such as Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Norway or Russia. For unsupported countries,
only the country code will be validated.

base,model,"ir.module.module,description",base.module_auth_ldap,"Adds support for authentication by LDAP server.
===============================================
This module allows users to login with their LDAP username and password, and
will automatically create OpenERP users for them on the fly.

**Note:** This module only work on servers who have Python's ``ldap`` module installed.

Configuration:
--------------
After installing this module, you need to configure the LDAP parameters in the
Configuration tab of the Company details. Different companies may have different
LDAP servers, as long as they have unique usernames (usernames need to be unique
in OpenERP, even across multiple companies).

Anonymous LDAP binding is also supported (for LDAP servers that allow it), by
simply keeping the LDAP user and password empty in the LDAP configuration.
This does not allow anonymous authentication for users, it is only for the master
LDAP account that is used to verify if a user exists before attempting to
authenticate it.

Securing the connection with STARTTLS is available for LDAP servers supporting
it, by enabling the TLS option in the LDAP configuration.

For further options configuring the LDAP settings, refer to the ldap.conf
manpage: manpage:`ldap.conf(5)`.

Security Considerations:
------------------------
Users' LDAP passwords are never stored in the OpenERP database, the LDAP server
is queried whenever a user needs to be authenticated. No duplication of the
password occurs, and passwords are managed in one place only.

OpenERP does not manage password changes in the LDAP, so any change of password
should be conducted by other means in the LDAP directory directly (for LDAP users).

It is also possible to have local OpenERP users in the database along with
LDAP-authenticated users (the Administrator account is one obvious example).

Here is how it works:
---------------------
    * The system first attempts to authenticate users against the local OpenERP
      database;
    * if this authentication fails (for example because the user has no local
      password), the system then attempts to authenticate against LDAP;

As LDAP users have blank passwords by default in the local OpenERP database
(which means no access), the first step always fails and the LDAP server is
queried to do the authentication.

Enabling STARTTLS ensures that the authentication query to the LDAP server is
encrypted.

User Template:
--------------
In the LDAP configuration on the Company form, it is possible to select a *User
Template*. If set, this user will be used as template to create the local users
whenever someone authenticates for the first time via LDAP authentication. This
allows pre-setting the default groups and menus of the first-time users.

**Warning:** if you set a password for the user template, this password will be
         assigned as local password for each new LDAP user, effectively setting
         a *master password* for these users (until manually changed). You
         usually do not want this. One easy way to setup a template user is to
         login once with a valid LDAP user, let OpenERP create a blank local
         user with the same login (and a blank password), then rename this new
         user to a username that does not exist in LDAP, and setup its groups

                                    About the size of a credit card — and just 5.4 mm thin — iPod nano is the thinnest iPod ever made.
                                    The 2.5-inch Multi-Touch display is nearly twice as big as the display on the previous iPod nano,
                                    so you can see more of the music, photos, and videos you love.
                                </p><p>
                                    Buttons let you quickly play, pause, change songs, or adjust the volume.
                                    The smooth anodized aluminum design makes iPod nano feel as good as it sounds.
                                    And iPod nano wouldn’t be iPod nano without gorgeous, hard-to-choose-from color.

                                        to iPod, and you can play the perfect mix for whatever

                                    How did we make an already gorgeous widescreen display even better? By making it 75 percent less reflective. And by re-architecting the LCD and moving it right up against the cover glass. So you see your photos, games, movies, and everything else in vivid, lifelike detail.

                                        The SoundLink® Mini speaker is small and light enough
                                        to tuck into your bag. It weighs in at just 1.5 pounds.
                                        Its low profile lets you place it almost anywhere and
                                        provides a low center of gravity that makes it nearly
                                        impossible to tip over.
                                </p>

                                    The rechargeable lithium-ion battery delivers up to seven hours of playtime.
                                    And at home, you can listen even longer—the charging cradle lets
                                    you listen while it charges.

                                    The speaker has a range of about 30 feet, so you can enjoy

                                    And it remembers the most recent six devices you've used,
                                    so reconnecting is even simpler.

                                <p>
                                    Unlike many small headphones, each earpiece of the Apple In-Ear Headphones
                                    contains two separate high-performance drivers — a woofer to handle bass and
                                    mid-range sounds and a tweeter for high-frequency audio. These dedicated
                                    drivers help ensure accurate, detailed sound across the entire sonic spectrum.
                                    The result: you’re immersed in the music and hear details you never knew existed.
                                    Even when listening to an old favorite, you may feel like you’re hearing it for the first time.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                    The Apple In-Ear Headphones deliver a truly immersive sound experience by drastically
                                    reducing unwanted outside noises. The soft, silicone ear tips fit snugly and comfortably
                                    in your ear, creating a seal that isolates your music from your surroundings.
                                    Three different sizes of ear tips are included so you can find a perfect fit for each ear.
                                    Also included are a convenient carrying case for the ear tips and a cable-control case
                                    for the headphones themselves.
                                </p>

                                    Inside each earpiece is a stainless steel mesh cap that protects the precision acoustic
                                    components from dust and debris. You can remove the caps for cleaning or replace
                                    them with an extra set that’s included in the box.
